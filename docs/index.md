# Variational Autoencoders Modular Bayesian Networks (VAMBN)

Welcome to the documentation for Variational Autoencoders Modular Bayesian Networks (VAMBN) 2.0. This version features a PyTorch-based HI-VAE (refer to [Nazabal et al.'s paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03653)) and employs [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to manage the workflow of Python and R scripts. Have a look at the [VAMBN page](vambn.md) for an overview of the project.
