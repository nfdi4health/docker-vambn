# Variational Autoencoders Modular Bayesian Networks (VAMBN)

This repository hosts the code for VAMBN 2.0. Unlike its predecessor, this version features a PyTorch-based HI-VAE (see [Nazabal et al.&#39;s paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03653)) and employs [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) to manage the workflow of Python and R scripts.
